Looking for a helpful list to add to my fake news detector.

**Hypothesis**
The main idea to fight fake news is to look at the authority
that is transmitting the news event. I am working on a system
that can juge of the quality of an internet source. If we can
verify the source we are on the right track for building a
fake news detector.

**Help the project and join the team :
  if you have a list your in...**

- FRIENDLY LISTS
- BLACKLIST
- WHITELIST
- URL DOMAIN LISTS
- CONCEPTS AND CATEGORIES LIST
- STOPLIST
- SPAM FILTERS
- AD FILTERS
- TRUSTED URL LIST  
- TOP-DOMAINS

**Lists, lists and more lists...**

Also looking for lists organized by specifique subjects.
If you have a special list covering a specific subject I
am very interested in this type of list.

**Fake News verification module will be a
core Search Engine component**

I am building a search engine. My smart-spider project and
this fake news detector are part of a bigger project.

**Some examples of wath is possible**
Just to give you an exemple:

- A high score on a spam filter can give us clues on the quality of a source.
- A blacklisted site should not be trusted with a news feed.
- A pre-authorize domain list could help qualify good sources for news
events on the Net.

**TESTING, TESTING and more TESTING**

Next step is running more tests to see if the concept works. We are also going to integrate the list concept to our smart-spider project.

You can check out the log file for our first results.
