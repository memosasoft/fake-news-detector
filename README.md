fake-news-detector-1.0

Lists, lists and more lists...

Spam filter list, quality keyword list, stoplist list,
top-domains urls list, news agencies websites list, university
websites list, business websites lists and government
organizations lists.

This gives us an initial score for the authority presenting
the information.

If we can verify the source we are on the right
track for building a fake news detector.

SPAM FILTER

The spam filter also gives us clues on the quality of the source.

TESTING, TESTING and TESTING

Next step is running more tests to see if the concept works.

Then we need to find more lists and maybe other tools like
an API that can give  us clues to identify if a specific website
is an authority in the matter or just making up some news.

I don't have all the answers but I am willing to code. It is a
complicated problem and we may be limited on what can be done.

I found an API that could help the project 

Search worldwide news 

with code Locate articles and breaking news headlines from news 
sources and blogs across the web with our JSON API. We could us 
it to validate if the story is fake or is trending.
