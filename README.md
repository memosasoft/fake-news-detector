Looking for a helpful list to add to my fake news detector.

**Lists, lists and more lists...**

Spam filter list, quality keyword list, stoplist list, dictionaries,
top-domains urls list, news agencies websites list, university
websites list, business websites lists and government
organizations lists, etc.

**You got a special list please share
with the project and join the team. **

Also a list organized by specifique subjects. If you have a special
list covering a specific subject I

I am also building a search engine. My spider project and
the website quality verification module being developed in
This project is part of the core component needed to make
my search engine work in a collaborative way.

**Hypothesis**
The main idea to fight fake news is to look at the authority
that is transmitting the news event. I am working on a system
that can juge of the quality of an internet source. If we can
verify the source we are on the right track for building a
fake news detector.

- SPAM FILTER 

- FRIENDLY LISTS 

- BLACKLISTED URL LIST 

- URL DOMAIN LISTS 

- CONCEPTS AND CATEGORIES LIST

- STOPLIST

- MOST TRUSTED URL LIST  

- TOP-DOMAINs LIST

**Some examples of wath is possible**
Just to give you an exemple:

- A high score on a spam filter can give us clues on the quality of a source.

- A blacklisted site should not be trusted with a news feed.

- A pre-authorize domain list could help qualify good sources for news
events on the Net.

**TESTING, TESTING and more TESTING**

Next step is running more tests to see if the concept works. We are also going to integrate the list concept to our smart-spider project.
