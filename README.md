**Lists, lists and more lists...**

Spam filter list, quality keyword list, stoplist list,
top-domains urls list, news agencies websites list, university
websites list, business websites lists and government
organizations lists.

**Hypothesis**
The main idea to fight fake news is the look at the athorithy 
that is transmitting the news event. I am working on a system
that can juge of the quality of an internet source.

If we can verify the source we are on the right track for building 
a fake news detector.

**SPAM FILTER - FRIENDLY LISTS - BLACKLISTED URL LIST - URL DOMAIN LISTS - CONCEPTS AND CATEGORIES
LIST - STOPLIST - MOST TRUSTED URL LIST - TOP-DOMAINs LIST** 

**Some examples of wath is possible**
Just to give you an exemple: 

- A high score on a spam filter can give us clues on the quality of a source. 

- A blacklisted site should not be trusted with a news feed.

- A pre-authorize domain list could help qualify good sources for news
events on the Net.

TESTING, TESTING and more TESTING

Next step is running more tests to see if the concept works.
