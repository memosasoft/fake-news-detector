# fake-news-detector-1.0

Lists, lists and more lists...

Spam filter list, quality keyword list, stoplist list, 
top-domains urls list, news agencies websites list, university 
websites list, business websites lists and governement 
organisations lists. 

This gives us an initial score for the authority presenting 
the information. 

If we can verify the source we are on the right
track for building a fake news detector.

SPAM FILTER

The spam filter also gives us clues on the quality of the source. 

BENCH TESTING 

Next step is running a bench test to see if the concept works.

Then we need to find lists that can give us clues to disqualify 
fake news. I dont have all the answers but I am willing to code.
